Work-in-progress tool; don't use this yet.

The ultimate objective is to make it easy to take over maintenance of abandoned open source projects. Git makes it easy to take over the actual *code*, but an open source project on a code hosting site like GitHub has more components than that - it also has issues, documentation wikis, and pull requests.

I aim to create both a command-line tool and a web app that will let users *fully* clone an abandoned OSS project, complete with all the valuable meta-stuff that goes along with the code. It will support at least GitHub and Google Code, including offering the ability to fork repos across code hosting websites.
